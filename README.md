### Running in docker (recommended)
_Note: all these commands can be run without Docker via eg: `yarn react-app:start`.  Docker is used to reduce some of the variables between different local Node environments._

##### install (on first run or after dependency changes)
```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/work --workdir /work -p 3000:3000  node:16 yarn install
```

##### run the dev server
```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/work --workdir /work -p 3000:3000  node:16 yarn react-app:start
```

##### Build for production
```
# PRODUCTION
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/work --workdir /work -p 3000:3000 node:16 yarn react-app:build-production

# STAGING
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/work --workdir /work -p 3000:3000 node:16 yarn react-app:build-staging
```

##### To deploy to AWS:

* Check that you have an `.env.production` file located at `packages/react-app/.env.production` containing:
  1. An Infura APP id for WalletConnect functionality - `REACT_APP_INFURA_ID=<app ID from infura>`
  2. The Public URL for the deployment - `PUBLIC_URL=<URL>`
* build the app (see above)
* Ensure you have an [AWS profile configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) called "nucypher", then `yarn deploy`
   * to deploy to staging `yarn deploy`
   * to deploy to production `yarn deploy production`
